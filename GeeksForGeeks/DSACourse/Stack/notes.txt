# Stack
LIFO

## Stack Operations
isEmpty()
push(x)
pop()
peek()
size()

## Corner cases for Stack

Underflow: When pop() or peek() called on an empty Stack
Overflow: When push() called on a full Stack

## Applications of stack

1. Function calls
2. Checking for balanced parentheses
3. Reversing items
4. Infix to prefix/postfix conversion
5. Evaluation of postfix/prefix
6. Stock span problem and its variations
7. Undo/Redo or Forward/Backward

# Stack using STL

All operations have O(1) time complexity

Stack can be implemented in any of underlying container that provides following operations:
- back
- size
- empty
- push_back
- pop_back

List, vector and dequeue all provide these functionalities. Thus, stack can be implemented using any of these containers. By default, stack is implemented using dequeue container.
Since stack is implemented using other containers and works as an interface, it is also called container adapter. Queue, priority queue are also container adapters.
All operation of stack are O(1) in all containers.
